        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Global Edge Network:</strong> Vercel uses a globally distributed edge network to deploy applications closer to end users. This results in minimal latency, faster content delivery, and high availability. By caching static assets at the edge and dynamically serving requests via serverless functions, Vercel ensures optimal performance for all users worldwide.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Automatic Scaling:</strong> With Vercel, applications automatically scale up or down based on traffic demands. This feature eliminates the need for manual intervention, ensuring consistent performance during traffic spikes or slow periods. Whether it's a sudden surge of users or regular operation, your application remains responsive and cost-efficient.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serverless Functions:</strong> Vercel supports serverless computing to handle backend logic without the need to manage physical servers. Developers can write functions in popular languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, or Go, and these functions are executed on demand. Serverless functions are ideal for APIs, form submissions, user authentication, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Vercel includes an intelligent image optimization feature that automatically resizes, compresses, and serves images in modern formats. This reduces page load times and enhances the user experience without compromising image quality. Developers can specify image parameters like size and format directly in their code.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Seamless Framework Integration:</strong> Vercel is built to work seamlessly with leading front-end frameworks, including Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular. It provides specialized support for Next.js, enabling developers to take full advantage of features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Preview Deployments:</strong> Every code change or pull request triggers a unique preview deployment. These preview URLs are shareable and provide an exact replica of the application in its current state, facilitating collaboration and faster feedback among team members during the development process.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Custom Domains:</strong> Developers can easily configure custom domains and manage DNS settings directly within Vercel's dashboard. This ensures professional branding and smooth domain management without relying on third-party tools.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Integrated CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> Vercel automates the build and deployment process through integrated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Developers can connect their repositories from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, and Vercel automatically builds and deploys changes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analytics and Monitoring:</strong> Built-in performance analytics provide insights into page load times, user engagement, and other critical metrics. Developers can monitor their applications to identify bottlenecks and optimize for better performance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Environment Management:</strong> Vercel allows easy management of environment variables for staging, development, and production environments. This ensures a smooth and secure workflow for applications with different deployment stages.
